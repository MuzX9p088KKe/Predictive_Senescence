# **<p align="center">Predictive Senescence</p>**

## Why did we choose Senescence? 

We are interested in determining the relationship of health and environmental factors on telomere length or vice versa. 
- In particular, we will be exploring the warbler bird population on the Cousin Island of Seychelles of the coast of Africa.

## Describe the source of the data

The data came from [this source](https://data.world/datagov-uk/e102ccd7-cd2a-4e73-8fe2-ec3f5f415ae5)


## Formulate hypothesis / questions to be answered with the data
### Hypothesis

Alternative Hypothesis - There is a positive correlation between telomere length and survival

### Questions: 

- How do environmental factors change telomere length? 
- Does the presence of dominant birds influence survival rates of the other birds?
- Is there a correlation between telomere length and the age class of the birds?
- Does the telomere length decrease over time for each bird? If yes, is the rate similar?
- Does pedigree influence telomere length?
