# Predictive Senescence

## Why did we choose Senescence? 
We are interested in determining the relationship of health and environmental factors on Telomere length or vice versa. 
- In particular, we will be exploring the warbler bird population on the Cousin Island of Seychelles of the coast of Africa.

## Describe the source of the data
TODO(@Robin)

## Formulate hypothesis / questions to be answered with the data
### Hypothesis
Alternative Hypothesis - There is a negative correlation between telomere length and survival

### Questions: 
- How do environmental factors change telomere length? 
  - Influence of dominant birds in survival rates of the other birds
