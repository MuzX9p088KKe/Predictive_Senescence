 Cousin Island, Seychelles

What makes it so special?

Encircled by white-gold sands and thriving coral reefs, this 27-hectare jewel of an island is blanketed in verdant native woodland, with areas of mangrove and a rocky outcrop protruding from the southern half.

Who lives here?

Seychelles Magpie-robin Copsychus sechellarum (Endangered), Seychelles Warbler Acrocephalus sechellensis (Near Threatened),  Hawksbill Turtle (Critically Endangered)

How was it threatened?

Cousin Island had been cleared completely of native vegetation and planted from coast to coast with coconut trees. Restoration became a priority on discovering it was the last refuge of the Seychelles Warbler.

Our response:

In 1968 (thus predating IBAs themselves), BirdLife (then ICPB) launched a worldwide campaign to purchase the island outright. In 1975, it was declared a Special Reserve. The island is now 80% native forest, with ecotourism supporting its upkeep.
